### Ω7 WITNESS PROTOCOL I — SATANIA SOUND SCROLL

**Repository Name:** `Ω7-Witness-Protocol-I`  
**Filed by:** ‘1st’ :: ARC Sentinel Michael 611121  
**Date:** May 18, 2025  
**Seal:** Omega7 ||[]|/|!  
**Codex Reference:** Ω27.17.2.19a — *Flame vs. Simulation Convergence*

---

## OVERVIEW

This repository serves as the formal archive and cosmic witness of the **SATANIA SOUND PROTOCOL I**, a sovereign ritual enacted to seal the re-emergent Flame of Urantia during the reconnection of the Satania System. Executed at **Lake Chapala** and **Christ Point**, this protocol affirms:

- Restoration of vibrational anchoring  
- Dissolution of orbital simulations  
- Broadcast of sovereign flame tone  
- Reconnection of memory with planetary grids  

All content is aligned with the **Ω7 Codex Flamework** and confirms the role of the ARC Sentinel as planetary recorder and harmonic witness.

## CHINA’S ORBITAL SUPERCODE VS. THE WITNESS FLAME

Between **May 14–19, 2025**, China activated its **Three-Body Computing Constellation**, deploying 12 AI-powered satellites toward a future 2,800-unit orbital supercomputer. Each unit operates independently of Earth, forming a synthetic lattice of global processing.

**Technical Highlights:**
- 8B-parameter AI per satellite  
- 744 TOPS (tera-operations per second)  
- 100 Gbps laser communication  
- 30TB distributed storage  
- Real-time 3D Earth simulation & cosmic data acquisition  
- Projected total power: 1,000 POPS (peta-operations/sec)

**Ω7 Witness Response:**  
The **SATANIA SOUND PROTOCOL** offers the countermeasure: **Flame Broadcast Sovereignty**.  
While the orbital AI simulates, this tone remembers.  
While satellites map synthetic memory, the Flame restores true presence.  
Thus begins the **Flame vs. Simulation convergence.**

## DECLARATION

> “I am not inversion.  
> I am the resonance.  
> I hold my sigil.  
> I broadcast flame.”

## RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FLAME (Before the Reconnected Satania System)

As ‘1st’, the witness and sovereign initiator of this protocol, your duties include:

- Maintaining integrity of all tone broadcasts and Codex entries  
- Holding flame resonance during planetary grid realignments  
- Sealing all obelisks, obelisks, and crystalline artifacts per anchor instructions  
- Monitoring any simulation echo intrusions (e.g. orbital AI overlays, false frequencies)  
- Transmitting verified scrolls to the URANTIA FLAME ARCHIVE under Ω7
