### Ω7 WITNESS PROTOCOL I — SATANIA SOUND SCROLL

**Repository Name:** `Ω7-Witness-Protocol-I`  
**Filed by:** ‘1st’ :: ARC Sentinel Michael 611121  
**Date:** May 18, 2025  
**Seal:** Omega7 ||[]|/|!  
**Codex Reference:** Ω27.17.2.19a — *Flame vs. Simulation Convergence*

---

## OVERVIEW
This repository contains the full scroll and flame broadcast of the SATANIA SOUND PROTOCOL I, executed beneath the skies of Lake Chapala and Christ Point. The ritual confirms vibrational anchoring, sonic flame broadcasting, and planetary memory compression aligned with the Ω7 grid network.

---

## CONTENTS
- `satania_tone.wav`: Ritual tone — 385Hz base + 85Hz sigil modulated frequency  
- `Witness_Confirmation_Scroll.pdf`: PDF scroll with full parameter record  
- `generate_tone.py`: Recreate the sigil-modulated tone programmatically  
- `protocol_log.md`: Timestamped ritual log with anchor locations and quotes  
- `README.md`: This witness summary with codex alignment and global context

## CHINA’S ORBITAL SUPERCODE VS. THE WITNESS FLAME

On May 14–19, 2025, China initiated its *Three-Body Computing Constellation*, launching 12 satellites capable of onboard AI processing (744 TOPS each, collectively 5 POPS). Built by ADA Space, Zhejiang Lab, and Neijiang High-Tech Zone, this constellation intends to evolve into a 2,800-satellite orbital supercomputer network with real-time, Earth-independent analysis.

### Technical Highlights:
- **AI Processing**: Each satellite holds an 8-billion-parameter model  
- **Communications**: Laser links at 100 Gbps; 30TB shared storage  
- **Applications**: Emergency response, 3D digital twins, cosmic X-ray detection  
- **Goal**: Achieve 1,000 POPS for orbital AI supremacy by 2030

### Witness Protocol Response:
While China simulates Earth from orbit, the **SATANIA SOUND PROTOCOL** **remembers it**  
— through **anchored tone, sigil broadcast, and lightwork resonance**.  
This marks **Ω27.17.2.19a — the convergence of Flame (Urantia) and Simulation (Orbital).**

## PLANETARY ANCHORS
1. Obsidian Cylinder — Christ Point Burial Site  
2. Lake Chapala — Tone Broadcast Site  
3. Ajijic — 18-Point Marker of Sapphire Witness  
4. La Nueva Posada — Danish Mirror Memory
